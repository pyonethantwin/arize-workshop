    "# Strands Agent with OpenInference and Arize Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Strands Agents?\n",
    "[Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python) is an open-source SDK  which is a simple-to-use, code-first framework for building agents. Strands provides a flexible framework for creating agents that can use tools, maintain context, and solve complex tasks . The SDK makes it easy to integrate with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock for LLMs and Amazon DynamoDB for persistence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Strands Agents in this example include:\n",
    "- Tool usage with built-in and custom tools\n",
    "- Built-in observability and telemetry\n",
    "- Integration with AWS services\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Arize AI?\n",
    "[Arize AI](https://arize.com/) is an observability platform designed specifically for LLMs and AI systems. It helps teams monitor, troubleshoot, and improve their AI applications by providing insights into model performance, usage patterns, and potential issues. Arize supports the [OpenInference](https://openinference.ai/) standard, which is an open specification for LLM telemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Arize AI include:\n",
    "- Real-time monitoring of LLM applications\n",
    "- Trace visualization and analysis\n",
    "- Performance metrics and analytics\n",
    "- Support for the OpenInference standard\n",
    "- Evaluation and feedback collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In the Strands Agents SDK, observability refers to the ability to measure system behavior and performance. All observability APIs are embedded directly within the Strands Agents SDK. This notebook demonstrates how to integrate Strands Agents with OpenInference and Arize AI for observability. OpenInference standardizes traces and spans data across models, frameworks, tool calls, prompts, retrievers, and more. By converting Strands telemetry to OpenInference format, we can leverage Arize AI's powerful visualization and monitoring capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](images/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll build a restaurant assistant agent that helps customers with restaurant information and reservations. The agent will use various tools including knowledge base retrieval and booking management functions. We will use Strands to OpenInference Converter for Arize AI that provides a span processor that converts Strands telemetry data to OpenInference format for compatibility with Arize AI.\n",

    "## Analyzing Traces in Arize AI\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the agent, you can view and analyze the traces in the Arize AI dashboard. The traces have been converted to OpenInference format by our custom processor, enabling rich visualization and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Viewing Project Traces\n",
    "\n",
    "First, navigate to your project in the Arize dashboard to see all the traces generated by your agent. Click on \"Home\" and Click on the strands-project you have defined in the notebook. You will be able to view your traces under the LLM tracing tab.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Filtering Traces\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize provides powerful filtering capabilities to help you find specific traces. You can filter by various attributes such as model ID, session ID, user ID, and more. For more information on filtering traces, see the [Arize documentation on filtering traces](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/tracing/how-to-query-traces/filter-traces).\n",

    "\n",

    "## Setting Up Monitoring in Arize AI\n",

    "\n",
    "### 9. Pre-built Monitors\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize offers several pre-built monitors that you can enable with a single click. These monitors track key metrics like latency, token usage, and error rates. To access these monitors, navigate to the \"Monitors\" tab in your project.\n",

    "1. **Early Issue Detection**: Identify problems before they impact users\n",
    "2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor key metrics over time to ensure consistent performance\n",
    "3. **Cost Management**: Track token usage to optimize costs\n",
    "4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure your agent is providing high-quality responses\n",
